# 🐍 Copy Python Qualified Path

A Visual Studio Code extension that adds a right-click menu option to copy the **fully-qualified Python path** of a class or method — just like PyCharm.

🔗 From this:

```python
# File: src/utils/mymodule.py

class MyClass:
    def get_numbers(self):
        pass
```

📋 To this copied string:

```
src.utils.mymodule.MyClass.get_numbers
```

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Adds `Copy Qualified Path` to the right-click context menu.
- ✅ Automatically detects the Python module path based on your project structure.
- ✅ Works with both classes and functions.
- ✅ Detects the enclosing class of a method automatically.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open any `.py` file in your project.
2. Right-click on a class or method name.
3. Select `Copy Qualified Path`.
4. The path will be copied in the format:
   ```
   your.module.path.ClassName.method_name
   ```

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Determines the Python module path by resolving the file's location relative to the project root (`.git`, `.vscode`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- Parses the current line to extract class or method definitions.
- If only a method is selected, attempts to find the enclosing class upward in the file by checking indentation levels to ensure the function is actually inside the class.

| File Path                          | Selection      | Copied Path                             |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `project/api/user/views.py`       | `UserView.get` | `project.api.user.views.UserView.get`    |
| `core/database/init.py`           | `setup_db()`   | `core.database.init.setup_db`            |

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Does it support nested classes?**  
A: Currently, it supports single-level classes. Nested class support is coming soon.

**Q: How is the module root detected?**  
A: It walks up the directory tree looking for `.git`, `.vscode`, or `pyproject.toml`.
